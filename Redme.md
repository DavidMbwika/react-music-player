Project Overview
The web app is a sleek, modern music player designed to deliver an immersive listening experience. It will feature a clean, responsive interface where users can browse, search, and play their favorite tracks seamlessly. Core functionalities include playlists, shuffle, repeat, and volume control, with additional options for creating custom playlists and managing favorite songs. Visualizations, such as waveforms or dynamic backgrounds, will enhance the user experience, while smooth animations will make interactions intuitive and satisfying. The app will also integrate APIs like Spotify or Last.fm to access vast music libraries and provide song metadata, album art, and recommendations.

Development Plan
The music player will be built using React.js for its fast, component-based development and responsiveness. The backend will utilize Node.js with a REST API to manage playlists, user data, and server-side operations. Firebase or MongoDB will handle data storage for user preferences and playlists. Iâ€™ll use CSS frameworks like Tailwind or styled-components for a visually appealing and mobile-friendly UI. Audio functionality will rely on the Web Audio API for high-quality playback and custom sound effects. Agile principles will guide development, focusing on rapid prototyping and user feedback to ensure a polished final product.
